## Removed support for UPnP to NAT-PMP
The support for UPnP(miniupnpc lib) was removed in PR [#31130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31130), I also did a Review Club on that which can be viewed here (https://github.com/Bitshala/BitcoinCore-PR-Review-Club/discussions/90).

### Testing the NAT-PMP auto-forwarding policy:
Checking out to rc2 tag,
```
git checkout v29.0rc2
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j 4

./build/src/bitcoind -natpmp
```
It was successful on my router and below is the startup logs:
```
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Config file arg: chain="main"
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Config file arg: prune="1000"
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Command-line arg: natpmp=""
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Using at most 125 automatic connections (1024 file descriptors available)
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z scheduler thread start
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Binding RPC on address ::1 port 8332
2025-03-25T07:41:33Z Binding RPC on address 127.0.0.1 port 8332
```

When executing bitcoind with `-upnp` option:
```
./build/src/bitcoind -upnp
``` 
I got a warning message as expected:
```
Warning: Option '-upnp' is set but UPnP support was dropped in version 29.0. Consider using '-natpmp' instead.
```

### Testing the PCP changes and IPv6 pinholing:
It was not successful on my home router
Router Model: JCO4032 
System: MacOS Sequoia 15.2 
Version tested: v29.0rc2
Result: Failed - No PCP response

```

Successfull PCP request would show like this:

```
