# p2p: Advance `pindexLastCommonBlock` early after connecting blocks #PR [32180](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180)

- Upstream Issue [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32179]

## Background: What is happening in IBD?
During Initial Block Download (IBD), a Bitcoin node downloads the entire blockchain from its peers to sync up to the current tip (the latest block). 
To optimize this process, the node maintains a [sliding window](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bb92bb36f211b88e4c1aa031a4364795cbd24767/src/net_processing.cpp#L110C1-L114C56) (typically 1024 blocks) to decide which blocks to request from which peers. 
The variable [`pindexLastCommonBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/bb92bb36f211b88e4c1aa031a4364795cbd24767/src/net_processing.cpp#L412) represents the last block that both the local node and a specific peer have in common. 
This helps determine where to start requesting new blocks from that peer.

When the node is "stalled" (not making progress), it might kick a slow peer and download the needed block from another peer. 
Once this block is received, it can connect hundreds of blocks at once, advancing the node's tip significantly. 
However, there’s a bug in how the next steps are handled, leading to inefficiencies and potential unnecessary peer disconnections.

## The Bug 

1. The stalling is resolved, Tip advances
    - The node is stalled, which led to the  kick of the peer and hence downloaded the blocks and connected
    - The new 1024-block window now has many open slots to request blocks for.

2. `pindexLastCommonBlock` is not updated immediately
   - In the next call to FindNextBlocksToDownload (a function that decides which blocks to request from a peer), the pindexLastCommonBlock for each peer is still based on the old tip (before the stall was resolved).
   - The function calculates the window of blocks to request ([`nWindowEnd`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e1dfa4faebf3192dc4d60b8f27d47d497b7dd25a/src/net_processing.cpp#L1386)) using this outdated `pindexLastCommonBlock`.
   - Only after this calculation does FindNextBlocksToDownload update pindexLastCommonBlock to reflect the new tip.

3. Consequences of the Bug
   - Inefficiency (Reason 1): The node wastes one call to `FindNextBlocksToDownload`, iterating over blocks it already has (below the new tip) just to update pindexLastCommonBlock. These blocks don’t need to be downloaded, so this is unnecessary work.
   - Incorrect Stalling Detection (Reason 2): If no blocks are requested from a peer in this call (because the window is based on an outdated tip), the node might think the peer is stalling again. This triggers a stalling timeout, potentially disconnecting a perfectly good peer,
   - even though the original stalling situation was already resolved.
  

## Proposed Fix (PR [32180](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180))

The PR aims to fix this by updating `pindexLastCommonBlock` earlier and using it to calculate a more accurate block request window. Here’s how:

1. Update pindexLastCommonBlock Early:
  At the start of `FindNextBlocksToDownload`, adjust `pindexLastCommonBlock` to reflect the new tip (assuming a linear chain with no forks). This makes sense because the node doesn’t need to request any blocks below the new tip from this peer.

2. Calculate nWindowEnd Based on New Tip:
  Use the updated `pindexLastCommonBlock` to calculate `nWindowEnd` (the end of the 1024-block window).
  This ensures the node requests blocks within the correct window (starting from the new tip), avoiding wasted iterations over already-known blocks.

3. Benefits:
  Efficiency: No wasted `FindNextBlocksToDownload` calls iterating over irrelevant blocks.
  Correctness: Peers won’t be incorrectly marked as stallers and disconnected, since block requests will align with the current state of the chain.

4. Additional Changes:
  The PR removes a special case (introduced in commit 49d569cb1fdd62a9da8dff51dccaf4680fe3d0eb) that’s no longer needed, as the updated logic handles it naturally.
  It updates a test ([`p2p_ibd_stalling.py`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32180/files#diff-503244ba97da2cc2db93fd6e7cfda5fff3db7bd0e78d637e3519fd556003341a)) to verify that peers aren’t incorrectly marked as stallers after a stalling situation is resolved.
