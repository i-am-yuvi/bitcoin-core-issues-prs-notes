# qa: feature_framework_startup_failures.py fixes & improvements (#30660 follow-up) 
- [PR #32509](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32509)


## feature_framework_startup_failures
This test is designed to verify that startup failures in the Bitcoin Core testing framework raise exactly one exception, 
rather than multiple cascading exceptions. This ensures that error messages are clear and specific, making it easier to debug what went wrong.

When you pass --timeout-factor=0, this calculation results in a timeout of zero. 
The subprocess module interprets a timeout of zero in a special way - it means "don't wait at all." 
However, when this zero timeout value is passed through to the lower-level polling mechanism, it causes an overflow error in the selector implementation.

### Fix in the PR
Uses a magic value (99999) that gets converted to None for subprocess. 
This directly engages with Python's subprocess API as intended, where None means "no timeout" - exactly what a user likely means when setting timeout-factor=0.

## Review

Small nit: I was thinking we could document the intention here or in the test framework regarding the chosen magic number (99999) 
for future contributors ‚Äî something like:

```
# Special case: timeout_factor of 99999 indicates user requested "no timeout" (originally set as 0)
# Python's subprocess.run() interprets None as "wait indefinitely"
```
